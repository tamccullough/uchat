question,asthma,"As a healthy, younger person, but with chronic asthma, am I at a higher risk?","Asthma certainly is a concerning issue, regardless of Covid-19virus so it's important to try to get your asthma under control and watch carefully for symptoms of shortness of breath."
question,countries strategy,Do you think there's any chance of countries doing a staggered approach to keep the load at health care facilities manageable?,People will be able to largely isolate for 2-3 months. If they can access testing including a home test kit then they will understand who is infected.
question,countries strategy,Is there still a way that countries can flatten the curve or are there things they can still do to ensure that they don’t encounter the worst case scenario.,"It's likely that the outbreak will continue on for some time. It might even go back and forth between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. Thus, I advise that you set up a system for confirming cases and strongly enforce social distancing."
question,countries strategy,"What do you think about the current countries who are not closing their schools, especially with countries who have 500+ infected?","Closing schools does cut down on the transmission of respiratory diseases like Covid-19. But each country must make its decisions based on its individual risk. Hopefully, world leaders are listening to the scientific experts and making sound judgments."
question,countries strategy,Why do some countries have such a low mortality rate?,It is likely attributed to early detection and implementation of conservative management. Deaths due to Covid-19 occur mainly in the older demographics.
question,countries strategy,How do we help the strain on our country's health system?,"As the numbers increase, yes, the system will start to get overloaded. But every region of the country has plans and training in place to handle these situations, and they're starting to prepare, just in case."
question,countries strategy,What measures can be easily translated and copied by almost any other country to stop the spread of the virus?,Social or physical distancing is the most important. 
question,countries strategy,Is there anything you can do to assist with ventilator production?,If we do social distancing properly then the surge of cases won't be as overwhelming. There will be enough ventilators.
question,countries strategy,What about the approach of not going to a full lockdown but rather try to spread it controllably in order to work towards ‘herd immunity’.,The only model that is known to work is a serious social distancing effort . If you don't do this then the disease will spread to a high percentage of the population and your hospitals will be overloaded with cases. So this should be avoided despite the problems caused by the shut down.
question,countries strategy,What businesses should be allowd to operate to maintain our economy while providing social distancing?,"Certainly food supply and the health system. We still need water, electricity and the internet. Supply chains for critical things need to be maintained. Countries are still figuring out what to keep running."
question,countries strategy,Why is it important to flatten the curve?,"When everyone gets sick goes to the hospital all at once, there is not enough beds for everyone. That is a peak in the curve. But when everyone practices social distancing, and it is more difficult for the virus to spread, there is usually enough beds to go around. That is a peak that can hopefully be flattened."
question,countries strategy,How is the economy likely to recover after all of this?,The economic impact of the shut down will be large but if it is done well eventually we can open back up.
question,countries strategy,Who should self quarantine?,"All non-healthcare workers, please self quarantine."
question,countries strategy,Do you think increased risk observed for physicians is an issue of PPE supplies or abundance of viral load?,"The problem is that once the virus has a very high initial transmission capacity, and the PPE supply is not adequate, it is difficult for the medical staff to effectively prevent respiratory transmission."
question,distancing,Do you believe this current social distancing will still be necessary worldwide in September?,"It may vary depending on the trend in the future, as well as on the particular local and national circumstances."
question,hand,What should I do to prevent myself from getting the virus?,"Wash your food(that you can wash), hands and surfaces frequently."
question,hand,Why should I wash my hands after touching shared surfaces?,"It is important to wash your hands regularly, because a person may have coughed and sneezed onto their hand and then handled a shared surface."
question,health,Can you explain what people can do to help in this moment of crisis?,A big thing is to go along with the shut down approach in your community so that the infection rate drops dramatically to let us go back to normal as soon as possible. Some people like health care workers will be doing heroic work and we need to support them. We do need to stay calm even though this is an unprecedented situation.
question,health,Could people who have recovered go help in hospitals with no risk of getting infected again?,"It's possible, if one is in good condition. However, one should use the same PPE as other healthcare workers."
question,mask,Are cloth masks helpful at all?,"If you have to go to a place where a lot of people are together in an enclosed space, we recommend wearing a cloth mask if you don't have something better. However, it is difficult to guarantee the preventive effect when using it for a long period of time."
question,mask,Media and health experts advise against the wearing of masks. Do masks provide any benefit to uninfected people?,"There are some confirmed cases where a mask had been worn by an infected patient thoroughly since the onset of symptoms, and no transmission had occurred to anyone else in contact. Thus, it seems safe to say that it would be beneficial for people with fever or respiratory symptoms to wear a mask than those with no symptoms."
question,mask,"Why can't I buy masks, if I am not sick, but want to protect myself?",There is a limited supply and healthcare workers absolutely NEED them right now.
question,mask,How important is it for the general population to be wearing masks when out?," It is recommended that you use it when visiting a medical institution, if you have fever or respiratory symptoms, or when you need to come into contact with high-risk or symptomatic patients."
question,mask,If you work in an essential job around other people should you be wearing an N95 mask even if you are showing no symptoms?,"Medical staff should be wearing the N95 respirator when contacting patients. However, N95 is not recommended for non-medical personnel. The N95 has a good preventive effect, but it is actually dangerous if one is not trained to put on and remove the mask as the chance of contamination can actually increase. In addition, when worn for a long period of time, the mask may lose its preventive effect."
question,national,d there be a national shelter in place order?,Most people can shelter in their home but for people who that doesn't work for there should be a place for them to go. so they don't have to go out and so the tests get to the people who are the priority. 
question,old,"Do you see any value in taking vitamins as a precautionary measure? I'm currently taking Vitamins C & D, Zinc and Elderberry. Figure it couldn't hurt, just wondering if it's worth recommending to others.","There actually is some evidence that Elderberry makes symptoms of a cold more tolerable, but there is no evidence it prevents infections. Keep in mind it also has to be boiled to prevent cyanide toxicity. But, we have been seeing a lot of talk about the idea of boosting your immune system, but please keep in mind that a lot of the reasons why people get respiratory distress is that the immune system is too activated, causing a cytokine storm and causing death. A really overactive immune system is really quite harmful."
question,old,What percentage of cases are under 40 years old?,50% of all patients are under the age of 40.
question,pandemic strategy,What do you see as the long-term strategy for fighting this pandemic and do you feel like it will adequately prepare us for the next?,I think that after this is under control that Governments and others will invest heavily in being ready for the next one. This will take global cooperation particularly to help the developing countries who will be hurt the most. A good example is the need to test therapeutics wherever the disease is to help the whole world. The Virus doesn't respect national boundaries.
question,pandemic end,When will this pandemic end?,To bring it to small numbers globally we need a vaccine. Many rich countries will be able to keep the number of cases small if they do the right things but developing countries will find it very difficult to stop the spread so a vaccine is critical.
question,pandemic,Do you think Covid-19 is the worst outbreak in modern times in terms of scale and severity ?,"Covid-19 is definitely worse than its cousins, SARS and MERS. Time will tell where Covid-19 ranks among influenza pandemics and other major epidemics. If Covid-19's case-fatality ratio remains the same and the virus infects as many people as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic or more, then Covid-19 could certainly go down as one of the worst, if not the worst, outbreak of all time."
question,pandemic last,How long will this pandemic go on?,This will vary a lot by country. China is seeing very few cases now because their testing and shut down was very effective. If a country does a good job with testing and shut down then within 6-10 weeks they should see very few cases and be able to open back up.
question,pandemic strategy,"Once this pandemic comes to a close, what should we do so that we are better prepared for the next pandemic?","We need to have the ability to scale up diagnostics, drugs and vaccines very rapidly. The technologies exist to do this well if the right investments are made. Countries can work together on this."
question,pandemic pregnant,Should women delay getting pregnant during this pandemic?,"It's difficult to assess the risks, but we think that if a pregnant woman is infected, it's quite dangerous because there are more limitations in terms of treatment, as well as the chance for decreased lung capability."
question,asymptomatic,Are asymptomatic patients infectious?,"There are conflicting reports but the answer tends to be no. The WHO notes that asymptomatic infection has been reported, but the majority of the relatively rare cases who are asymptomatic on the date of identification/report went on to develop disease. It’s important to note that the proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear since we aren’t yet widely testing asymptomatic patients, but appears to be relatively rare and does not appear to be a major driver of transmission."
question,asymptomatic,Are you concerned there are a lot of asymptomatic carriers and transmissions occurring in densely populated areas?,"It is still unclear whether asymptomatic patients infect others, and even if they do, we consider that they take up a small portion of infections."
question,patients,Does the virus leave permanent lung damage in patients who needed hospitalization and recovered?,It is unlikely. A study from China showed the damage healed after 31 days.
,second again,Is it possible to be infected by the same strain again? how soon? will it be more severe the second time?,"There is still too much speculation surrounding this, and we can't give a definitive answer yet."
question,second again,Have there been people who have recovered who have become sick again and tested positive again?,"Yes there are cases. However, those patients did not spread the virus to other people."
question,hydroxychloroquine,Thoughts on chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine?,There are a lot of therapeutic drugs being examined. This is one of many but it is not proven. If it works we will need to make sure the finite supplies are held for the patients who need it most. We have a study going on to figure this out. We also have a screening because the number being proposed is very large and only the most promising should be tried in patients.
question,patients,What are the most common symptoms in patients?,Patients typically show symptoms such as sore throat and shortness of breath. Most complete recoveries have no aftereffects. A small minority are known to have decreased lung functionality.
question,patients,What is your protocol to treat unstable patients?,"We evaluate the patient's risk and confirm that it is necessary for PCR testing. In cases of unstable patients, they will be sent to isolation facilities. If not, they will still be isolated from others in facilities that have ventilators."
question,protocol,What is your protocol to treat people who have light symptoms?,"We evaluate the patient's risk and confirm that it is necessary for PCR testing. If the patient is stable, he or she is expected to wait at home until results are obtained."
question,protocol,What is your protocol to treat people who have severe symptoms?,"We evaluate the patient's risk and confirm that it is necessary for PCR testing. If the patient is high-risk, the patient/group is tested, and if needed they will be hospitalized."
question,recovery,Do people who are infected and recover become immune and can’t get reinfected?,"Yes, to some degree. Usually infection and recovery presumes immunity. This is generally what we are seeing out of Asia."
question,recovery,Has there been any signs of permanent damage after recovery?,"Not at this stage, there hasn't. But we're still early in our understanding of the virus, and its lasting effects."
question,recovery,If people can get reinfected after recovering doesn’t it make it that much harder to successfully flatten the curve and to build herd immunity?,"Yes, but we think this is likely an outlier scenario and much less likely."
question,recovery,Do people who are infected and recover become immune and can’t get reinfected?,"Yes, to some degree. Usually infection and recovery presumes immunity. This is generally what we are seeing out of Asia."
question,social distancing,Do you believe this current social distancing will still be necessary worldwide in September?,"It may vary depending on the trend in the future, as well as on the particular local and national circumstances."
question,surface,How often should I clean surfaces?,There is some evidence that shows that the virus can be found on surfaces for up to 7 days. It would be good choice to clean more regularly in order to be safe.
question,common symptoms,What will happen to a someone who has common or mild symptoms?,"What we can say based on what has been observed. Day 1: The first symptom is usually a fever. You might have fatigue, muscle aches, and a dry cough. Day 5: You might get worse shortness of breath at this point, especially if you have other medical problems. \Day 17: The symptoms continue, but get milder and milder until you get fully better. The trajectory is a lot like a flu, and how bad it is depends on your baseline health. "
question,common symptoms,What are some common symptoms?,"The first symptom is usually a fever. You might have fatigue, muscle aches, and a dry cough. The symptoms continue, but get milder and milder until you get fully better. The trajectory is a lot like a flu, and how bad it is depends on your baseline health."
question,common symptoms,"If someone is infected with the virus with mild to moderate symptoms, are there any at-home or over-the-counter treatments we can use to prevent more severe symptoms from developing? If hospitals become overburdened and deny admission for severe cases, are there any at-home or over-the-counter measures we can take to ease severe symptoms?","It's similar to what you do with the flu or any other respiratory virus: fluids, lots of rest, keeping distance from other people, so that they don't get sick."
question,common symptoms,"Describe mild symptoms are we talking something like a regular cold, maybe a flu?","Mild symptoms. The most common symptoms are: fever, dry cough, fatigue. As well, some may experience the following which you might see with the flu as well; putum production, shortness of breath, sore throat, headache, muscle aches, joint pains, chills, nausea or vomiting. Mild really does mean mild, and runny nose/ runny eyes probably means you dont have COVID."
question,symptoms,Do you know the true range of symptoms?,"Via the World Health Organization: As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases, typical signs and symptoms include: fever , dry cough , fatigue , sputum production , shortness of breath , sore throat , headache , muscle or joint pain , chills , nausea or vomiting , nasal congestion , diarrhea , and coughing up blood , and conjunctival congestion i.e., red eye . The WHO says the clinical course for the novel Covid-19virus--how the symptoms develop stage by stage--has varied case by case. The CDC lays out a clinical course based on a review of available medical studies, here: "
question,prevention,Do you recommend herbal remedies?,"There actually is some evidence that Elderberry makes symptoms of a cold more tolerable, but there is no evidence it prevents infections. Keep in mind it also has to be boiled to prevent cyanide toxicity. But, we have been seeing a lot of talk about the idea of boosting your immune system, but please keep in mind that a lot of the reasons why people get respiratory distress is that the immune system is too activated, causing a cytokine storm and causing death. A really overactive immune system is really quite harmful."
question,prevention,"I'm in self quarantine for days but my roommate still goes out, if they catch it, how can I prevent myself from getting it?","Get out of the house ASAP, move to a safer place, and self-quarantine yourself while monitoring your symptoms."
question,symptoms,What is the main reason I should decide it's time to go to the hospital with this?,"If this were any other disease, would I go to the hospitals with the symptoms I am having? If I have what feels like a Flu, I may have muscle aches and feel crummy, but if I’m still able to eat and drink and get some rest, I should stay home. If, instead, I get really short of breath and can’t keep any food down, I’d definitely head in."
question,symptoms,What should I do if I have a cough or I am feeling sick?,Stay home. Send people to get groceries or have them delivered by people who aren’t coughing or showing symptoms.
question,severe symptoms,What are some severe symptons of Covid-19?,"Shortness of breath, or air hunger, such as breathing more than 30 breaths a minute. If you're breathing fast or can't catch your breath while speaking, that is severe and you should be seen by a doctor immediately"
question,vaccine,"Is there any chance that the 18 month timeline for development of a vaccine can be shortened, and by how much?","The work for a vaccine is going at full speed. We will have to build lots of manufacturing for the different approaches knowing that some of them will not work. Keep in mind, that the first vaccines we get will go to health care workers and critical workers.  While this could happen before 18 months if everything goes well, governments do not want to promise anything with regards to timelines."
question,vaccine,"Can the development of a vaccine can be shortened, and by how much?","The safe answer is no. Vaccines require testing to make sure they are safe and effective. So it is important to not rush the process. Furthermore, once one is found, the first vaccines we get will go to health care workers and critical workers."
question,vaccine,How close are we to a cure or vaccine?,"A lot of efforts being put into developing the cure. Unfortunately, it seems very unlikely that we will be able to develop an effective anti-viral drug or a vaccine under a short period of time. Even if we're lucky to find the cure, it will probably take over a year to actually put it into use."
question,virus weather,Does weather have any effect on the spread of the virus?,"It's been speculated that the activity of the virus will decrease in heat and humidity, but whether such is the case is unclear. I believe it unlikely for the climate to be a factor affecting the virus, given that the pandemic is also occurring in countries with subtropical climates."
question,virus testing,Who should get priority in testing for the virus?,Priority situations should get tested within 24 hours. This is very possible since many countries have done it. Health care workers for example should have priority. Elderly people should have priority.
question,virus mutate,Are there possibilities of this virus mutating into a less deadly but more contagious version of itself? Do you think there is any evidence to support this with the data we have that it can be happening? And If it's not happening now do you think it is possible it could in the future?,"RNA viruses, such as Covid-19virus, are characterized by mutations. I think there is a possibility of a new virus or mutation for the Covid-19virus."
question,virus,Are you seeing an increase risk of illness for health workers treating Covid?,"The problem is that once the virus has a very high initial transmission capacity, and the PPE supply is not adequate, it is difficult for the medical staff to effectively prevent respiratory transmission."
question,virus young,Can young people get sick from Covid-19?,"There have been reports of younger people ignoring social distancing recommendations and then potentially returning home from gatherings and spreading COVID. Young people are just as susceptible of becoming infected. They stand a greater chance of beating the disease, but they can still infect others, even if they get better. "
question,virus surface,Could you explain whether it's possible to get infected by touching an infected surface?,The World Health Organization says that Covid-19 can indeed be spread via fomites aka surfaces contaminated by the virus.
question,virus manmade natural,Do you think the virus is manmade or is it natural?,"Check out from one of the leading geneticists working on Covid-19. In short, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has genetic elements that, could not be predicted/designed in advance by humans, based on everything we knew about the virus family."
question,virus heat,Does heat kill Covid-19?,"Heat doesn't kill it, but it does make it harder to spread."
question,virus immunity,"Does recovering from Covid-19 confer immunity, at least until the virus mutates?",Tthere has been no evidence that people who get it once get it a second time. Thus to most people that would mean you have immunity.
question,virus pregnant,"Have you and your colleagues seen pregnant women, unborn children and newborns/infants sick with Covid-19virus?","We do have confirmed cases among pregnant women and infants here in Korea. However, it's difficult to compare it with other groups because there have been very few cases."
question,pandemic strategy,How long does it generally take for herd immunity to form on a new virus? How exactly does that occur?,"This question is tricky, because what you're really asking is What is the herd immunity threshold for the novel Covid-19virus? The herd immunity threshold is the percentage of the population that needs to develop resistance to a disease in order to stop transmission chains between people. You can find one of my favorite illustrations of this concept . But this threshold varies by disease. For measles, you need 90-95% of the population to have immunity, either through vaccination or naturally through infection, for effective herd immunity. For mumps, it is 75-86% Those thresholds are dependent on transmission rates, as others describe in this thread, but it also depends on how/if our bodies can develop long-lasting immunity to the disease. That, in turn, that depends on the virus' evolution but also on how our bodies respond to the virus. For example, the seasonal flu virus mutates so fast that we need a new vaccine each year. Even then the vaccine is only 50% effective, which factors into why it is hard to build complete herd immunity against influenza. For dengue, there are multiple strains of the virus, they circle back at random times to spawn outbreaks, and our bodies can't seem to develop immunity that can cover all of them. We need to learn more about all of these matters before we can know if herd immunity is possible for Covid-19 and how fast it might occur."
question,symptoms cough,I and others in my family have a mild cold/cough. How do I know if it's Covid-19?,"All the data so far is suggesting that a runny or congested nose, or watery eyes are less likely to be part of Covid-19. Its a really quick and easy way to tell that you probably don’t have it, especially since we’re facing so many testing shortages. "
question,mask,I continue to hear mixed advice on the use of masks. Some outlets have recommended against using them. Others say it can reduce my chances of getting Covid-19. What is the complete answer about masks and Covid-19?,"Masks can definitely decrease the risk for infection from Covid-19. The thought is that it is transmitted via large droplets, which a mask should help prevent. HOWEVER, we have a shortage of masks worldwide, so rather than making a large purchase of masks if you are young and healthy, it’s best to try to leave them for older patients or those with significant medical illnesses. Thats why you may be hearing mixed messages."
question,virus mutate,"I'm particularly worried about, virus mutation, how likely is the Covid-19 to mutate, and at what rate? Is it a mutation that restricts the possibility of a one-time vaccine? Is there a possibility that the virus may very well become a seasonal pandemic that mimics the seasonal cycle of the flu?","Covid-19viruses, like influenza, are RNA viruses, which means they are more prone to mutation than other types of viruses. With influenza, these mutations happen so often that it forces us to make a new vaccine each year to tackle the evolving strains. Hard to know if the same will apply for the novel Covid-19virus, given a vaccine has not been developed yet. But not all mutations are beneficial mutations. While the novel Covid-19virus is certainly changing in its genetic makeup in real-time, this habit doesn't automatically mean that the virus is becoming more dangerous. Here are a couple resources about that: Yes, there is a chance that Covid-19 will become seasonal. "
question,virus spread,If a droplet of a person who has Covid-19 happens to fell into our food? Does this means people who consume it becomes infected?,"I believe there is a low chance that Covid-19 would spread through food. The virus is structurally equivalent to the enveloped virus, which is known to transmit poorly through the GI tract. The mucous membrane of the respiratory tract, and the eye, should be protected the most."
question,virus death,If i get infected what are my chances of dying?,I don't think that anyone can predict an individual person's chances of being killed by the Covid-19virus. But epidemiology can glimpse what groups might be at a higher risk.
question,recovery,"If you are diagnosed with Covid-19 and make a successful recovery, can you get the virus again?","With many viral illnesses, a successful recovery means that most people won’t be reinfected, as the body has built up an immunity to the virus. We sometimes see reinfection in patients who are ill or immunocompromised, but even that is rare. With the flu, it actually has multiple strains so when there is “reinfection” it’s often a second infection with a different strain. So, based on what we know so far, it should be very hard to be reinfected with Covid-19. "
question,recovery,"If you’ve had Covid-19. and you’ve recovered, are you still contagious? Will you still test positive?","After the infection of the Covid-19virus, there are cases where the PCR test came out positive even though the person has completely recovered. In such a case, we are concerned about the extent to which the virus is contagious, but it is difficult to confirm whether the result is evidence of a viable virus or a dead virus. Most experts believe that even if it is PCR-positive, the spreadability will be very low when recovered."
question,virus 1918 flu,In 1918 we saw the Spanish Flu dissipate during the warmer months only to reappear during the fall. Do we expect the same with Covid-19?,"We will presumably see a drop in cases in the summer. And even if there is a dip in cases in the summer, the southern hemisphere will be entering its cold and flu season."
question,prevention,"Is it realistic to attempt to avoid infection, or should I just be preparing to make myself comfortable at this point?","You want to do all you can to avoid an infection: be it Covid-19, or a regular cold or flu. Wash your hands. Avoid touching your face. Avoid large gatherings if there is an outbreak in your area."
question,pandemic virus,"On a scale of one to ten, how bad is this outbreak currently","9 to 10. As it pertains to a novel disease, I would describe SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19 as a worst-case scenario, in terms of the speed of transmission, the medical outcomes, and the public response to it. A emerging influenza outbreak--like 2009 H1N1 or 1918 Spanish flu--are the only respiratory pandemics on par."
question,countries strategy,What actions do you think the governments can take to help slow down the spread of Covid-19?,A plan to address the lack of hospital beds for large-scale patient outbreaks.
question,virus symptoms,What are some rare symptoms of Covid-19?,"Nasal congestion, diarrhea, coughing up blood stained mucus, viral red eyes and watery discharge from the eyes, with sensitivity to bright light."
question,prevention,"What can I do to minimize my risks of becoming seriously ill and being hospitalized aside from social distancing, washing hands, and quitting smoking?","Social distancing, washing hands, and quitting smoking are a great start. With a disease like Covid-19, the big key is minimizing risk, whether it be via preventing transmission and guidelines) or by getting the body into its best state for handling an infection. We've covered what the virus can do to the body in these stories: Also, don't be afraid to check in with a doctor, if you have one. One of my favorite quotes from the underlying conditions story: “When there's a great deal of misinformation in the public arena and when there's much that we don't know yet about the virus, this is the time to use your medical contacts."
question,countries strategy,What one thing do you wish people would stop saying about this epidemic?,"Two things: 1) Naysayers should stop claiming that Covid-19 isn't dangerous and that only the elderly/infirm need to worry about it. As the disease threatens a wide spectrum of people. 2) Nnaysayers should stop claiming that the news media is exaggerating the risk. Many members of the news media are risking their lives to report these stories, and public awareness is the only tool available for showing people the importance of infection control tactics like social distancing."
question,virus,What would your best response be to those that are saying It's just a flu?,"Evidence also shows that Covid-19 is more fatal across all age groups than seasonal influenza, with death rates six to 10 times higher for those under 50. Moreover, death isn’t the only danger, and severe cases of Covid-19 are more common among young adults than you might think. Also, naysayers need to realize that flu and Covid-19 are separate illnesses, and both deserve our attention for their own serious reasons."
question,prevention,What is the one thing besides washing our hands and distancing ourselves from others that we can do to help stop the spread and transmission of the virus?,What is the one thing besides washing our hands and distancing ourselves from others that we can do to help stop the spread and transmission of the virus?
question,prevention,Do you have any tips for me on staying safe and healthy?,Reduce face-to-face contact with the people as much as possible and practice thorough hand washing hygiene.
question,virus,How long can the virus last in the air?,A recent study showed it can last in the air for up to an hour after a sneeze or cough.
question,countries strategy,"If the virus continues to spread in densely populated areas, what are our options when facilities fill up?","Countries have a limited number of ventilators. This is why it's important for the public to do their part and self quarantine, if necessary. But the government is taking steps to increase manufacturing capability/pace of ventilators."
question,asymptomatic,What should I do if I am asymptomatic?,"Everyone who is symptomatic absolutely should stay home in self-quarantine - you WILL spread the virus if you go out, so please get someone else to bring you items you need."
question,wash,Why shouldn't I touch my eyes?,The virus has been shown to aerosolize and also be able to spread via our eyelashes.
question,wash,What precautions should I take when delivering things such as groceries to family members to limit my exposure to them?,Hand washing is key. Keeping a distance. Having someone else do it if you have a fever or are coughing.
question,wash,What should I do with vegetables that I have bought from the store?,Absolutely wash your vegetables and food that can be washed after coming home from the supermarket.
question,world,Can you provide any estimates for how much of the world's population might become infected?,"This will vary a lot by country. Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore acted quickly and will have very few cases. Even China will stay at a low level of their population so far. Thailand is another exemplar. Unfortunately in poorer countries doing social distancing is much harder. People live in close proximity and need to work to get their food so there could be countries where the virus will spread broadly."
question,world,Do you believe this current social distancing will still be necessary worldwide in September?,"It may vary depending on the trend in the future, as well as on the particular local and national circumstances."
